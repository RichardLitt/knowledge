# Desired Features for GitHub

I wish GitHub were better. While there's already a lot of cool tools I use to make it better - namely, [hub](https://github.com/github/hub), [git-extras](https://github.com/tj/git-extras), and [ghi](https://github.com/stephencelis/ghi) - there are still things that I want to change in the long run, or at least highlight as issues. This, like [isaac's github repo](https://github.com/isaacs/github) is a place to list those for myself.

_NB: Since this is a list that has no pretensions of anything but being a place to log issues, I may at times blatantly copy and paste from various blogs and stuff._ 

Issues with GitHub:
* Can only view diffs on a single page (can be very slow).
* Comments are sent as they are written; you cannot "draft" comments.
* Cannot compare differences between patch sets.
* To create a patch one must fork the repository publicly.
* Accepting a patch creates a "merge commit" (ugly repo history).
* In general, pull request culture is not about code review.
