# Brainstorming

Studies have repeatedly shown that brainstorming doesn’t work in groups.[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorming#Alternatives_to_brainstorming). I’m interested in trying to figure out how to work around this problem, or what the best way to approach this recurring scenario is for me: I have a colleague or partner I’m interested in thinking of ideas with, and we schedule a call together to hash things out.  

Open questions:

- Is a one-on-one call the best way to collaborate? Is a one-to-many call a better way?
- What metrics can be used to evaluate brainstorming and ideation?
- Is there a better way to synergize? Does the context of the call matter, or the situation?
- How does time-of-day and energy effect output?

Curious.
