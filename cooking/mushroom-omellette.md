## Ingredients
- Three eggs
- Coconut milk
- Ghee
- 200g mushrooms
- One half yellow onion
- Rosemary
- Salt
- Pepper

## Instructions
- Head up a non-stick saucepan to medium-heat
- Add the ghee until it is melted. It has a higher flashpoint than butter, so works better.
- Chop the onion and cook in the ghee until carmalized.
- Slice mushrooms
- Take out and add to the plate.
- Add chopped mushrooms - it's better if they have room to breathe.
- Remove onions when they start to sweat, before they become cooked all of the way through. This ensures that they keep their flavour.
- Turn the pan to low heat. 
- In a bowl, beat three eggs with a fork and add a couple of tablespoons of coconut milk (or milk, or water if you don't have the others).
- Add the eggs into the bowl.
- Add salt and pepper, while gently lifting the sides once they cohere in order to let eggs around.
- When most of the liquid is cooked, add a couple of tablespoons of onions and mushrooms to the omellette.
- Add rosemary.
- Remove from heat.
- Eat.
