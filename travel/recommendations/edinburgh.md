# Going to Edinburgh

First, there's a Mountain Goats song for this: https://themountaingoats.fandom.com/wiki/Going_to_Scotland

I don't know much about accommodation, in general, having never rented a room in Edinburgh. I do know it may be easier in June than in August, as that's when the Fringe is. I'm not sure I would stay near the Grassmarket, as it is rather loud and rowdy at times. My favorite areas in Edinburgh to walk in are likely the Old Town and Grassmarket, however, and Dean Village and Stockbridge, largely because I like water and there's old buildings in a valley with a lovely burn running through it - so I would try and stay there. It's nice to walk through Dean Village, in any event, so set aside time for that if you can.

I love the Scottish Poetry Library, but also want to suggest the Writer's Museum, higher near the Castle. The Edinburgh Central Library has a lovely reading room upstairs, although the desks are a bit horrid, but I would try also the Playfair Library if you can find a way to visit it, in Old College. Stepping into the Old College at the University of Edinburgh is a matter of a simple act, and is quite nice just to look at from the square inside.

I would suggest the National Museum of Scotland on Chambers Street, which is always free, so you can go in and out as you like. All of these, along with Greyfriar's Bobby (miss the pub, I was kitchen staff there and it's alright but there's better food anywhere else), Greyfriar's Kirkyard (the kirk is nice, too, sometimes - if you can, go to this event there on the 8th, I love the acoustics in there (but this is where Tom Riddle is buried, so there's that)), and St Giles on the Royal Mile are pretty much within three minutes of each other. So is McEwan Hall, for that matter, which is kind of a nice building to look at, if you like old buildings. The Castle is cool, too, but I rarely go in. The Jolly Judge near the castle is my regular.

The Scottish Poetry Library is much closer to Holyrood Palace, which is alright if you like rich people. Personally, I like Arthur's Seat the most in Edinburgh, although allocate a few hours to walking up it, and be prepared for wind! The Salisbury Crags are also worth walking up if you just want a look at the city, and may be a bit easier, although Arthur's Seat is deceptively small to our Vermont eyes - those aren't trees on top, those are people. I am always surprised how much it isn't a four-hour hike, at all, but more like an hour one of slow bird-walking.

My favourite bookstores are Edinburgh Books and Armchair Books, in the West Port next to the strip club. Mr. Wood's Fossils is also kind of cool. Tills Bookstore is nice, too, near the Meadows. Books are poor traveling companions, though, as they tend to weigh you down.

If you've got a violin, go to Sandy Bells. If you've got a liver, don't. I used to like the Royal Oak, but I think it's a bit small.

The Art galleries on the Mound are also free, and worth a gander. You can convalesce after too many paintings in the Princes Street Gardens.

I like Brewlab for coffee. Actually, let me know if you want coffee suggestions at all. I stay in Merchiston when I am here - there's a nice canal if you like canals, and I always like walking around the Meadows, which is my old haunt. It's lovely.

There's a market under the castle on Castle Terrace some days. That's a nice thing to go to.

Want a longer trip? Go to Cramond and check the tides, and walk out to the island. You can see the Forth Bridge from there, too. Or, better, go to North Berwick or Musselburgh and enjoy the pebble beaches.

Let me know if you're going elsewhere, or have time to travel.
