# Logging NFCs

## On recording computer
- Transfer the file from the Windows box to Mac
- Update the timer to reflect the next astronomical twilight period.

## On Mac
- Detect and classify calls
- Sign into eBird using your station account
- Identify periods in the calls when a checklist would be good - keep them at one hour
- Create a new NFC checklist, with this commentary:

> Recorded using an OldBird 21c microphone, recording to a NUC7CHYJ using I-Recorded on Windows 10, at 22050Hz, mono, 16bit. Analyzed using Vesper (https://github.com/HaroldMills/Vesper).

- Count the number of calls in Tseeps and start with that in passerine, deleting as you go along. Then, add in thrushes afterwards.
- Create a checklist for each hour of recording.
- Share results with the Listserv
