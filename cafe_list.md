# Cafes

_This list is to get to know cafes in general. It is not as good as [diasdavid/awesome-hacking-spots](https://github.com/diasdavid/awesome-hacking-spots), which has an understandably different function._

## Canada

### Montreal

#### Cafe Code Noir

Note: The wifi is bad. It is quiet, which is nice, but the wifi just isn't tolerable for real work.

#### Dispatch

Corner of Duluth and St. Laurent

1.75 Mbps up, 0.35 down. Not good.
