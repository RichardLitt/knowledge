# Music for working

I tend to like working to music, because it helps me get rid of some excess stimulation.

Here are some albums that have consistently been shown to work:

- Anything by LTJ Bukem
- Shapeshifter
- Fat Freddy's Drop
- Berlin Techno

Currently trying listening to:

- Jack Johnson

Which makes me wonder - is the choice of the album or artist as important as the consistency of listening experience? What role does novelty have?
