# Things to do without internet

First, are you sure you can't connect? If you're offline but you don't want to be, try resetting your MAC address. Try using [spoof](https://github.com/feross/spoof):

```sh
$ spoof --help
```

More to come as needed. (This fixed my issue this morning.)

Go read a scientific article. Sometimes, waiting is all you need to do.
