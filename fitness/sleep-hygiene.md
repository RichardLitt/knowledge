# Improving Sleep By Using A Routine

- Avoid Caffeine, Nicotine, Alcohol

Alcohol makes you sleepy at first, but not later. Caffeine depresses sleep. Tobacco is an all around jerk. Don't use any of these 4-6 hours before bed if you can.

- Maintain a good bedroom

Dark curtains are best. Open them in the day to ensure you get light; but the darker, the better at night. Keep the air cool - around 60Â°F is a good temperature. Make sure your pillows and mattress are comfortable.

- Sleep routine

Do the same thing every night. Read before bed; avoid screens. Do something that is not emotionally taxing, like not thinking about work. Go to the bathroom before sleeping.

- Shower or bathe before bed

Take a bath or wash your face. A cold shower will activate your sympathetic system, so try not to do that; however, a hot shower will also elevate your heartrate. It seems that the up and down itself will make you fatigued, as well as the feeling of being washed. Take a short, hot shower, or a bath, at least thirty minutes before bed. This works well combined with reading in bed, later.

- Don't lie in bed

If you're there longer than 20 minutes, get up and read in low light, or listen to music. Don't just wait it out.

- Don't stay in the house or the bedroom all day

Get light and exercise. Exercise before 2:00pm if you can - this will give your body time to adjust.

- Nap early, or don't.

Don't nap after 4:00pm. This tends to interfere with your ability to go to sleep.

- Don't have heavy meals late

Try and eat before 8:00pm.

- Balance fluid intake

Take enough to not be thirsty, but not so much that you need to get up to go to the bathroom.

- No phone in the bedroom

Put the alarm somewhere else, where you won't look at it. This also stops you doing things you don't need to do on the phone while trying to sleep.
