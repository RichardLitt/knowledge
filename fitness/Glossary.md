- **Gastroc**: Basically, your calves. Yes, the gastrocnemius muscle, often referred to as the "gastroc," is a major part of what is commonly known as the calves. The calf muscle is comprised of two primary muscles: the gastrocnemius and the soleus. The gastrocnemius is the larger and more superficial of the two, contributing significantly to the bulge seen in the calf. This muscle is involved in activities like running, jumping, and walking, as it helps in plantarflexing the foot (pointing the toes) and flexing the knee.
