# Cold Showers

Most mornings, I wake up, stand up, make my bed, turn on the kettle for coffee in the kitchen, walk to the bathroom, and brush my teeth, in generally that order.  Then, I step into the shower, turn on the cold water, and try and hyperventilate for around thirty seconds. When I feel adequately ready, I step in, and bathe in the coldest water for around a minute or two, until I feel like I've made the entirety of my body cold, and until I start to feel a warm flush coming on from the effort. Then, I dry off, go put on some clothes, take the kettle off the burner, and start the day.

Why do I do take cold showers first thing in the morning?

- There's been some studies that suggest it may fight inflammation. [Cite Wim Hof]
- It gets me in touch with my breath [Cite Naval Ravikant].
- It prepares me for the cold, Canadian winter. I am more likely to run outside in the cold if I feel that I am somehow better for not feeling the cold.
- I start the day doing something hard. The rest of the day, I can lean on that thing.
- It gives me the opportunity to do the haka on a regular basis.
- "Swallow a live frog every morning, and there'll be nothing worse all day." - Paraphrasing of Mark Twain [SOURCE]
- Cold water activates the [sympathetic nervous system](https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/sympathetic_nervous_system.htm). This gives me an opportunity to get into flight or fight mode, and to choose which I am going to do - fight? or fly? Iâ€™d rather the former.
