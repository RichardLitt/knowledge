# Tight Calf Muscles

These can be a major problem. In my case, they lead to a stress fracture in my 3rd or 4th metatarsals.

## Things to change
- Stop sleeping in the fetal position.
- Stretch your foot every three hours using a belt. I'm not sure the name of this.
- Get shoes with 12-15Â° of tilt forward from the heel. Don't get any pronation; your retroverted hips don't need this, and you actually want to push off your toe more, to give your metatarsals less weight.
- Shorten your stride, aim for 185 tempo.
