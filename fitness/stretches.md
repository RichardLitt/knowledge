## Wall Shin Raises

Begin by standing with your back to a wall. Place your heels about a foot away from the wall while your body is resting on the wall. Begin to dorsiflex (bring toes up) both ankles while your heels remain in contact with the ground.

Stretch your toes up as far as possible. Lower your feet back toward the ground. Try to keep your toes from touching the ground. Repeat for 3 sets of 10-15 reps.

## Wall Squat

- Lean against the wall

- Start the movement by pushing your hips back.

## Plank
- Abs, lower back
- Like a pushup, but just lean on your elbows

## Side Plank
- From plank position, press your right hand into a mat and turn your body so your weight is on the outer edge of your right foot; stack your left foot on top. Imagine you have a big beach ball under your right side; press your torso up and away from the ball, extending your left arm with fingers pointed toward the sky. Tighten your lower-ab muscles and brace your entire core. Hold for 60 seconds, then return to plank position and repeat on the left side; thatâ€™s 1 rep. Do 3 reps.
