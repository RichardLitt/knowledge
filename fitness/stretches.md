## Wall Shin Raises

Begin by standing with your back to a wall. Place your heels about a foot away from the wall while your body is resting on the wall. Begin to dorsiflex (bring toes up) both ankles while your heels remain in contact with the ground.

Stretch your toes up as far as possible. Lower your feet back toward the ground. Try to keep your toes from touching the ground. Repeat for 3 sets of 10-15 reps.
