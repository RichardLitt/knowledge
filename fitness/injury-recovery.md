# Injury Recovery

How do I recover from injuries faster?

In the past two years, I've had multiple injuries.
  - Some serious injury with my foot, in the summer of 2016. Couldn't run the Edinburgh marathon (for the second time).
  - Shin splints in Berlin. As far as I can tell, this was the result of missing a week of runs, and then running 11m (3m more than my floor) on the flat concrete of Tempelhof, after training on dirt and elevation in Montreal.
  - Foot injury at the ball of my feet, lasted two weeks, on the way back from Edinburgh, July 2017. Couldn't walk for a few days, lost what I had built up.
  - Anterior flexor issue, October 2017. Couldn't walk, got worse after a few days.

Each time, the injury takes at least a few weeks to recover from.

## Notes from research

- If you're going to start down this road, figure out what you're actually doing. That means get data.
- You hate gamification passionately. Which is awkward. Because you use it and are affected by it every day. You need to get over this issue. Take three breaths when you hear the word gamification. Recognize that it is OK. Control it.
- Do things five times.
- Measure them.
- Embrace loss.


## To Do

1. Find a place to get a DEXA result.
2. Look for personal BodPod
2. Buy a tape measurer and measure yourself. 142.5
3. Estimate bodyfat pg 54
