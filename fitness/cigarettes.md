# Cigarettes

- You have far more anxiety and anxious episodes, particularly in the middle of the night, when you smoke. Anxiety is not useful, and does not seem to be tied to any external changes (I've been anxious when I've been rich, and I've been anxious when I've been poor). Anxiety seems to trigger thoughts of burnout - I am less likely to like JavaScript at 3 in the morning.
- The chances that any individual cigarette will taste good, on a new take, are around one third. You'll enjoy the cigarette more if you've had something to drink, but you'll also not actually taste the cigarette, so it's more likely that you're just less aware of it and you're enjoying being outside. The lone cigarette is rarely actually soothing.
