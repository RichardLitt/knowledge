# Heart Rate Variability

> Heart rate variability (HRV) is the physiological phenomenon of variation in the time interval between heartbeats. It is measured by the variation in the beat-to-beat interval.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate_variability).

> Heart rate variability (HRV) as a simple way to measure readiness to train. It's also an ideal biomarker for tracking your workout progress, which allows you to avoid overtraining and running into low cortisol issues.

> I like to call Heart Rate Variability “the glue marker”. It is a powerful biomarker that binds together other subjective and objective data for more effective decision making. When measured alone, without any other context, HRV tells you the general state of your nervous system and health but cannot tell you what is causing or affecting your condition.
> Tracking HRV in conjunction with additional context such as energy levels, fitness tests, sleep quality, a food log, etc. can help you identify what specific lifestyle factors are most affecting your systemic health and progress.

## How to Optimize your HRV

- Diet
- Lifestyle
- Exercise
- Sleep

## How to avoid common mistakes

- Use accurate hardware.
- Determine if paced breathing is right for your situation.
- Track a few other subjective and/or objective metrics alongside HRV dependent on your goals.
- Measure 5+ days per week.
- Measure in the same position at the same time of day (or understand the effects of these differences).
- Measure more than once before making any conclusions (5+ is best).
- High HRV can be good or bad – context helps.
- Low HRV can be good or bad – context helps.
