# Plants

I have house plants. I do not know how to take care of them. This can be remedied.

### Types of plants

1. Large palm near window.
2. Bamboo near computer.
3. Christmas cactus
4. Ivy x4
5. That skinny plant in the kitchen.
6. The palm on my living room table.
7. The pine in the window.
8. The tree near my bed.
9. The dying big plant near the living room table.
10. The rosemary outside.

## To Do

- Get names of all of these plants
- Figure out what kind of environment they like
- Figure out their watering schedule
- Add it to your calendar
