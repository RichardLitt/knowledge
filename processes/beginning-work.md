# Beginning a project

When working on a difficult project, it's often hard to just begin. To do so, here is a checklist to help out. Copy it and make it project specific.

Before beginning, ask yourself:

* *Are you well rested?*
* *Do you need to go to the bathroom?*
* *Do you have time for the task you're planning on?*
