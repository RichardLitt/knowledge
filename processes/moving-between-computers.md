# Moving between computers

If you are switching computers, say, before going on a long trip:

1. Run `dotfiles`.
2. Run `git-unsaved`.
3. Sync 1Password.
4. Make sure there is nothing in the Downloads or Desktop folders, as this should all be synced.
5. Sync Dropbox and SpiderOak.
6. Copy all movies and media to your external HD.
