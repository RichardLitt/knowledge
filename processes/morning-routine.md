# Morning routine

Read this until it sticks.

On any given day:

- Wake up at 6:00am
  - Can be earlier; the goal is for this whole routine to take less than two hours
- Make bed
- Drink 16oz of water
- Take a progress photo of yourself
- Run or exercise for 45 minutes
  - Acceptable: Walking (if sore from yesterday), running, walk-runs, boating, skiing, snowshoeing, tai chi, swimming
- Drink 16oz of water
- Shower, of which 5 mins. must be cold
  - Can be hot to begin with, or a sandwich
  - Can be removed if the exercise involved five minutes in a cold body of water
- Meditate for 20 minutes
- Name three things or people you're grateful for
- Visualize success for 10 minutes
  - Can be written; can use prompt to remind you of your goals
- Choose 8 tasks for the day
  - Must move you forward in some aspect of your life towards your goals
  - Cannot be habits
  - Can be written down the night before to make things easier.
- Drink 16oz of water
- Make coffee, breakfast, etc...

The goal of this routine is not to make you sleep deficient. Instead, it's to make it easier on you to have exercise in early, to work on your mindfulness training before you get sucked into the day, and to state, at the beginning, what a day will look like.
