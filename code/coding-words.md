- **DI**: Dependency injection. A form of IoC, where implementations are passed into an object through constructors/setters/service lookups, which the object will 'depend' on in order to behave correctly. [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6550700/inversion-of-control-vs-dependency-injection)
- **IoC**: Inversion of Control. A generic term meaning rather than having the application call the methods in a framework, the framework calls implementations provided by the application. [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6550700/inversion-of-control-vs-dependency-injection) [Blog](https://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html#InversionOfControl).
- **POA**: Proof of Authority. An algorithm used with blockchains that delivers comparatively fast transactions through a consensus mechanism based on identity as a stake. [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_authority)
