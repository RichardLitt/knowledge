# The Anthropology of Fantasy

The idea: build a suitable wiki or collection of notes about fantasy civilizations and/or medieval living using quotes from books you read.

## Medicine

- Inner birch bark is a mild painkiller. Rothfuss, _The Name of the Wind_, 583.

## Funeral Rites

- Barrows are only built in low, marshy places where you can't dig a grave, or where it is traditional. Rothfuss, _The Name of the Wind_, 584.

## Military

- Forts are built mainly where they have a good outlook; but they will not be built on hills that don't afford water, or are "too pointed". Rothfuss, _The Name of the Wind_, 584.
  - Note: This goes against your own personal recollection of Sintra, Portugal.
