# Articles

This is a list of articles I have read in part of in whole, which I looked up because I was curious about something or other. I keep this here because it is reflective of changing interests, as well as of what I have recently on my stack. Feel free to suggest wikipedia articles to me using any messaging means; I would love to know more, in general.

- [Publish-subscribe Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern), Wikipedia.
