# Kitchen Sponges

"Using a sponge is dirtier than not using one."

I don't know the record about sponges - are they dirty? Are they worth using? How often should you get new ones?

After some research this morning - mostly on unscientific sites, because it is hard to find cold, hard facts about sponges - I have made the following conclusions:

- Throw out your sponges regularly (once a week probably too much, once a month probably OK.)
- Cut off a corner and re-use them elsewhere if you're keen on keeping them for other purposes
- Boil them in water regularly to keep them from becoming evil. This seems better than microwave (long, risk of burning), or bleach (not near food thanks)
- Buy ecofriendly sponges. There are dyes and chemicals that aren't great in standard ones, and they should be recyclable.
- If they smell, they have tonnes of bacteria. Act accordingly.
- Use a paper towel on meats and poultry stuff (for instance, cutting boards).

If at all possible, use a dish cloth. These are longer lasting, better for the environment, and can be washed in the washer easier.

## To Do

- Boil sponges
- Buy ecofriendly sponges
- Buy dishcloths
  - Test out how a dishcloth works in practice
