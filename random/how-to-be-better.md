# How to be better

* Breathe three deep breaths between tasks.
* Don’t remind people to do things if they don’t want to do them.
* Approach every situation with a calm attitude, without ego or shame.
* Delegate more.
* Never leave a one line comment on GitHub. You can do better than that.
* Chunk time during the day to help other people. Chunking is better than planning on doing stuff randomly. Give without thought of getting. [1](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-ongchoco/how-to-become-a-successfu_2_b_6209078.html).
* Say "You're welcome, I'm happy to help. I know you'd do the same for me." instead of just "you're welcome". [1](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/adam-grant/pay-it-forward_b_4270340.html)
- Set a schedule the night before. Choosing a task for the morning to focus on is too risky a task to leave to the morning.
- Logging time is better than not logging time.
- Choose the hardest task, first.
- When you stumble on some words or notice you are straying verbally, don't say "I am incoherent" or make noises. It doesn't help your point. Pause and speak slowly.
- Think about the long tail of effort when you start a project. Don't just dive in.
