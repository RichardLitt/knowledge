<p>Hey all!</p>
<p>Another week, a few new things to talk about.</p>
<h2 id="websitethelittreviewhttpswwwburntfencomthelittreview">Website: <a href="https://www.burntfen.com/the-litt-review/">The Litt Review</a></h2>
<p>I've overhauled my old book lists and made <a href="https://www.burntfen.com/the-litt-review/">The Litt Review</a>. I'll start reviewing books here from now on, and will slowly go through and review the books I've already read <a href="https://www.burntfen.com/books/2017">this year</a>.</p>
<p>Right now, there is only one review - <a href="https://www.burntfen.com/the-litt-review/the-restaurant-at-the-end-of-the-universe/">The Restaurant at the End of the Universe</a>. Expect more.</p>
<p>There's a newsletter you can sign up to, as well, so you'll get the reviews when I write them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This morning, I do what I do every Sunday morning. I got out of bed, made fresh coffee, and turned on my computer to start writing something in my journal. I opened Spotify to play some music, and realized immediately what I’d be writing about — proselytizing algorithms intruding into my daily life. If God made man, and men made machines, I find it curious that we’ve figured out how to put God in them, too.</p>

<h2 id="tousewritegoodhttpsgithubcombtfordwritegood">To Use: <a href="https://github.com/btford/write-good">write-good</a></h2>
<p>I maintain <a href="https://github.com/btford/write-good">write-good</a>, a project by my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/briantford">Brian Ford</a>. It is a naive linter for English prose. This week, <a href="https://github.com/Vorror">@vorror</a> added and I merged <a href="https://github.com/btford/write-good/issues/70">E-Prime mode</a>, which allows you to lint to all uses of the verb <em>to be</em> in your text, in case you're trying to eschew copulas to make your writing a bit more evocative. Kind of a fun little project.</p>
<h2 id="towatchdecentralizedwebmontrealmeetup1httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdrndbujomsa">To Watch: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRnDBUJomSA">Decentralized Web Montreal Meetup #1</a></h2>
<p>I gave a talk this week at the first Decentralized Web Meetup in Montreal, about IPFS. I'm a co-organizer, and was excited to see a couple of dozen people come to the Bitcoin Embassy to hear about the decentralized web. Francis Brunelle (the other organizer) gave a talk about Dat and Beaker, and Mathieu Gagnon (the host) one about Steem.</p>
<p>I recorded the video, with the help of <a href="https://twitter.com/ssstofff">Kristof Bernaert</a>.</p>
<h2 id="ask">Ask</h2>
<p>I'm looking for people who <em>really</em> love their backpacks, and love talking about what they keep inside them. If you're one of those people, get in touch - I've got a project I think you'll love collaborating with me on.</p>

<p>That's all! Enjoy your weekend and take care, folks!</p>
<p>If you have any thoughts, just hit reply; I'll respond to every email I get here.</p>
<p>Best,<br />
