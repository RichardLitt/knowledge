Hey all!

Another week, a few new things to talk about.

---

## Website: [FirstImpressions.io](https://firstimpressions.io)

I launched a website last week, just to see if I could do it in under four hours. I've been held up with another website for over a month. Today, I finished it; I'll launch it on Tuesday, which is historically a good time to launch things. Watch this space.

I wrote about why I launched FirstImpressions.io, below. It's an interesting read.

## To Read: [How to Create a Consultancy and Start Pitching in Four Hours](https://medium.com/@richlitt/how-to-create-a-consultancy-and-start-pitching-in-four-hours-7d545a7e878f)

> First Impressions didn’t exist when I finished Game of Thrones. I have learned things about the industry - in particular, about how hard it is to reach marketing departments — that I didn’t know at all. I’m better situated now to know what that market is like, and I’ve actually done something in it. No money yet, but results aren’t everything.

> All in all, this was the best Friday night I have spent in a while.

## To Use: [Markdown To Medium](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/markdown-to-medium)

[@yoshuawuyts](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts) has this sweet little module that enables you to publish directly to [Medium.com](https://medium.com) using Markdown. I've been using it for a bit, but there were some things I wanted in the implementation. For instance, the ability to add tags, and fixing the canonical URL link, and to pass in arguments using the CLI instead of through YAML frontmatter. So, I spent a few hours implementing them, and then looked over every issue and pull request, giving my feedback. A few hours later, Yoshua said I could help maintain it, so now I do. Open source at it's best.

If you publish to Medium, it's worth looking into this, as it lowers the friction between writing and publishing. I use this in combination with this [tinyletter script](https://github.com/RichardLitt/tinyletter-script), which I made the same night using another library, to automatically publish to Tinyletter and Medium together.

## To Watch: [Francis Bacon & Eggs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0JvfnVQ8K4)

Didn't we already have a Francis Bacon & Eggs video? Yes! But I wanted to let you know that I haven't stopped making them. This is episode no. 6. I fully intend to keep making eggs and making videos, until we've read the entire book.

## Ask

I'm planning a trip north on [Tshiuetin Rail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tshiuetin_Rail_Transportation) to Schefferville, in the north of Québec. This rail is not connected to the rest of the North American rail system, and would take around 12 hours and strand us in the isolated, sub-arctic community of [Schefferville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schefferville) for a few days. I plan to write a short book about the experience, and publish a short documentary to go with it.

Anyone want to come with me?
