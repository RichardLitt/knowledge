# Letters from Richard: SustainOSS, standard-readme-linter-regex, ...

Hey all!

Another week, a few new things to talk about.

---

## Website: [SustainOSS.org](https://sustainoss.org/)

I am helping to organize a one-day conference in SF in June for sustainers - people who are interested in making open source software not just doable, but sustainable in the long term for the community and for developers. The purpose is to gather 50-100 leaders in open source sustainability for a one-day conversation with a facilitator to advance the state of the art.

If you're interested, get in touch!

## To Read: [The Litt Review: Spirits in Bondage](https://www.burntfen.com/the-litt-review/spirits-in-bondage/)

This was not a heavy public writing week for me - too much traveling around (I am currently in Berlin). Here's my book review of the spectacularly horrible _Spirits in Bondage_ by a young C.S. Lewis.

## To Use: [standard-readme-linter-regex](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme-linter-regex)

Unsure if your README is valid for [standard-readme](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)? Use this linter to find out. My buddy Joe just made his first PR ever to it. I've been using it over at [Maintainer.io](https://maintainer.io) a lot these past few weeks.

## Ask

Know anyone who lives in Berlin? I'm here for a couple of weeks, and I love meeting people for coffee.

That's all! Enjoy your weekend and take care, folks!
