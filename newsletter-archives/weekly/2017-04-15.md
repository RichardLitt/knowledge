Hi friends!

Another week, a few new things to talk about.

## Website: [Maintainer](https://maintainer.io)

I launched a company this week that will help the Open Source world, by taking pressure off of developers and putting it on an outsourced service. Maintaining an open source project is hard, and takes a lot of energy. What I do at [Maintainer Mountaineer](https://maintainer.io) is help out, by making sure that the documentation and entry points to the code are clear, standardizing repository formats, providing templates for responding to people opening issues and pull requests, and also jumping into tense conversations as a third party and helping to diffuse stress.

So far, we've had a few clients, and gone out on [npm's weekly newsletter](https://medium.com/npm-inc/npm-weekly-90-install-a-code-of-conduct-with-npm-npm-at-women-who-code-2017-search-scopes-e0d927f09435), which goes to around 40k people. So, that's been interesting to watch!

If you run an open source project or if your company does open source, get in touch. I'd love to work with you.

## To Read: [OSS Maintenance as a Service: Helping maintainers maintain their code](https://medium.com/@richlitt/oss-maintenance-as-a-service-helping-maintainers-maintain-their-code-f9717e4990ad)

I wrote up a Medium launch article for Maintainer Mountaineer. [Check it out](https://medium.com/@richlitt/oss-maintenance-as-a-service-helping-maintainers-maintain-their-code-f9717e4990ad).

## To Use: [awesome-remote-job](https://github.com/lukasz-madon/awesome-remote-job)

If you like remote work, check out this list by [@lukazs-madon](https://github.com/lukasz-madon) that I maintain on resources for remote living. There are articles, books, job boards, companies that have remote work in their DNA, communities, and so on. It's worth a glance.

## To Watch: [How I Made My Own iPhone - in China](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leFuF-zoVzA)

My cofounder from [The User Is My Mom](https://theuserismymom.com), Scotty (Pam's son), launched a video this week which has already had 2.5 million views. It's great! Go watch it if you want an interesting view into Chinese electronics markets and hacking stuff together.

## Ask

Do you have open source code on GitHub, or does your company? What would you like to do with it? What's holding you back?
