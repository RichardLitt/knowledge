Hey all!

Another week, a few new things to talk about.

## Website: [The Litt Review](https://www.burntfen.com/the-litt-review/)

I've overhauled my old book lists and made [The Litt Review](https://www.burntfen.com/the-litt-review/). I'll start reviewing books here from now on, and will slowly go through and review the books I've already read [this year](https://www.burntfen.com/books/2017).

Right now, there is only one review - [The Restaurant at the End of the Universe](https://www.burntfen.com/the-litt-review/the-restaurant-at-the-end-of-the-universe/). Expect more.

There's a newsletter you can sign up to, as well, so you'll get the reviews when I write them.

## To Read: [Spotify: Stop assuming I'm a Christian, please.](https://medium.com/@richlitt/spotify-stop-assuming-im-a-christian-please-c9cd49319a6e)

> This morning, I do what I do every Sunday morning. I got out of bed, made fresh coffee, and turned on my computer to start writing something in my journal. I opened Spotify to play some music, and realized immediately what I’d be writing about — proselytizing algorithms intruding into my daily life. If God made man, and men made machines, I find it curious that we’ve figured out how to put God in them, too.

## To Use: [write-good](https://github.com/btford/write-good)

I maintain [write-good](https://github.com/btford/write-good), a project by my friend [Brian Ford](https://twitter.com/briantford). It is a naive linter for English prose. This week, [@vorror](https://github.com/Vorror) added and I merged [E-Prime mode](https://github.com/btford/write-good/issues/70), which allows you to lint to all uses of the verb _to be_ in your text, in case you're trying to eschew copulas to make your writing a bit more evocative. Kind of a fun little project.

## To Watch: [Decentralized Web Montreal Meetup #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRnDBUJomSA)

I gave a talk this week at the first Decentralized Web Meetup in Montreal, about IPFS. I'm a co-organizer, and was excited to see a couple of dozen people come to the Bitcoin Embassy to hear about the decentralized web. Francis Brunelle (the other organizer) gave a talk about Dat and Beaker, and Mathieu Gagnon (the host) one about Steem.

I recorded the video, with the help of [Kristof Bernaert](https://twitter.com/ssstofff).

## Ask

I'm looking for people who _really_ love their backpacks, and love talking about what they keep inside them. If you're one of those people, get in touch - I've got a project I think you'll love collaborating with me on.
