# Letters from Richard: On become a hermit, osx-learn, and Francis Bacon...

Hey all!

I am not the timeliest of newsletter writers. It has been almost three months since I sent my last Friday newsletter. In case you were eagerly waiting for it to appear, I apologize.

In the intervening time, I've produced very little in the way of online content. A few blog posts, here and there. A few small essays. A few tools on GitHub. However, for the most part, I have been away from my keyboard for a long time - catching up on client work, hiking in the Scottish mountains, hanging out with friends in Berlin and San Francisco. Now, I am back in beautiful, green Montréal, soaking up the humid summer.

Here are some things from the past week that may entertain you.

## To Read: [On New Hampshire (and the urge to become a hermit)](https://tinyletter.com/practice/letters/on-new-hampshire)

> Can you have your cabin in the woods, your upper middle-class isolation, my rows and rows of books by people I'll never meet, and not have a redneck with Budweiser around the corner, not be surrounded by Trump voters?

## To Use: [osx-learn](https://github.com/wooorm/osx-learn)

This is a CLI tool to automatically add words to your OSX dictionary. It is super, super useful, and made by my friend [@wooorm](https://github.com/wooorm).

## To Watch: [Francis Bacon & Eggs: Of Marriage and Single Life](https://youtu.be/UOle9lhBfLo)

Another episode in my world-famous cooking show.

## Ask

What literary journals do you read? I'm currently actively submitting poetry for publishing, and would love to know what you like.
