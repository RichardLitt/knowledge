<h1 id="howtocreateaconsultancyandstartpitchinginfourhours">How to create a consultancy and start pitching in four hours</h1>
<p>After the Game of Thrones episode, we sat in a mild stupor for a few minutes. Another character we liked was dead. It was 9:00 at night; we had been watching Game of Thrones over dinner, and then moved to the couch to finish the episode. Now the evening lay before us.</p>
<p>"Should we watch another one?"</p>
<p>I hovered over the next file, and realized that I wasn't happy with that prospect. It would lessen the emotional force of our beloved character dying, for one. And, for two, I wasn't doing anything. I was passively watching a TV show I had seen before, a story I knew so well <a href="http://dothraki.org">I founded a community</a> around it. I can do better than this.</p>
<p>"No, I want to make something."<br />
"Ok."</p>
<p>That's all it took. We got up, I put the kettle on to make some tea, and I sat down to work. I had had an idea in the back of my mind for months, but I hadn't been actually doing it. The idea was to write gambling websites and casinos, and pitch <a href="https://theuserisdrunk.com">The User Is Drunk</a> at them. I'd never done it, but I'd kept it as a bit of a last resort, just sort of mulling over the concept in my mind. "Well, when I'm screwed, I can do this at least."</p>
<p>Why not now?</p>
<p>It might be hard, and I saw myself getting stuck for hours on something stupid. I'd spent the last month trying to get one project out of the door, and wasted three weeks on thinking of a name for it. I didn't want that. So, for this project, I gave myself a three hour deadline. Within three hours, I would build a consultancy website, I would do market research, and I would email 30 different companies asking if I could help them out.</p>
<p>Seems reasonable.</p>
<p>So, that's what I did. I did some market research on other UX consultancies aimed at Casinos. Most of their sites were atrocious. I decided mine had to be only 50% better. It didn't have to be great. I wanted a different site than The User Is Drunk, because I didn't want it to be too tied to that brand - I wanted to pass myself off as a legitimate agency, even if it was only me.</p>
<p>Naming was easier. I had bought <a href="https://firstimpressions.io">firstimpressions.io</a> years ago, but hadn't used it due to paralysis analysis. I decided sacrificing it to this effort wouldn't be the worst thing in the world. Good - domain and name done. Next?</p>
<p>I found a theme for <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>, which looked OK, downloaded it, found a header image on <a href="https://unsplash.com">Unsplash</a> , edited the content, threw in some logos for past clients of mine, set up Google Analytics and an email address alias for the domain, pushed the entire site to <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a>, added SSL, tested my build, added some custom CSS to make the title pop out a bit on the site because I didn't want to spend too much time making it look pretty, and wrote a pitch email.</p>
<p>Any time I thought to myself, "I should make this better", I remembered the deadline. No thinking. No asking for advice. Don't get stuck on research. Just do. Over and over again, do.</p>
<p>I did all this in three hours. I spent an hour after looking at gambling websites, and realized that most of them hide away their 'About Us' pages, and don't have a public email except for customer support. I started writing emails to customer support, and, after a few live chats with their website's supports, realized that I needed to pitch to CS to get me through to Marketing, and that this was the normal flow. I made a template, but then edited each email to make it clear that I had looked at their site and at their specific issues, as opposed to spam. I got one bounce.   </p>
<p>I set up a Google Sheet and wrote down each company I contacted,  and how I did it, and what their contact information was. By 12:30am, I had written 12 different companies, and I was a bit tired. So, I went to bed.</p>
<p>In the morning, I was a bit shocked. I had gone from zero to market in less than four hours. Sure, the site - firstimpressions.io - won't win any awards. The content needs a major overhaul and rethink. I need to find a way to get through customer support emails to the actual marketing and promotions team. I need to choose if I want to talk to marketers or to their development departments.</p>
<p>I've got one response, and that was from a Twitter user after I asked them for their contact email. So far, no one has responded to me emails. I don't care.</p>
<p><a href="https://firstimpressions.io">First Impressions</a> didn't exist when I finished Game of Thrones. I have learned things about the industry -in particular, about how hard it is to reach marketing departments - that I didn't know at all. I'm better situated now to know what that market is like, and I've actually done something in it. No money yet, but results aren't everything.</p>
<p>All in all, this was the best Friday night I have spent in a while.</p>
<p>Tonight, what will you do with yours? Watch another episode, or make something?</p>
