# Running as Suffering

> I like it, to suffer. I really love it, to be out, many hours, suffering.   
  
This is what Kilian Jornet says after running and skiing dozens of miles in one day in Norway [(YouTube)](https://youtu.be/7eVBrMcflDE?t=10m11s). I love this quote, and I’ve kept coming back to it in the past few weeks.   
  
On Saturday, I ran twelve miles in Montréal. Not an astounding distance - Monday was the Boston Marathon, and all of the participants ran further than I did - but a large distance, for me. I’ve only run a half marathon’s distance a dozen times or so, all told. This run was a bit different. I carried a pack with me, filled with things - a book, a water bottle, a banana, an iPhone, a hat. And every time I saw a hill, I had one rule - you have to run up it.   
  
I ended up running five hills in a row. Overall, I did 1500ft of elevation. When you consider Mont Royal is only 764 feet (233m) high, that’s a lot of doubling back and going up and down again. Arthur’s Seat is 822 ft (250m), and I’ve done that 25 times in one day [once](https://www.facebook.com/events/10152962908214480/).   
  
Through it all, I kept repeating to myself, “This is fun. I like suffering.” And it was true. But it was a drag. I wondered at times if I would ever just enjoy running for itself, as opposed to enjoying the pain it gives me. 
  
But today - an early morning run, at around 8:00. The sun was shining bright, it’s clear here in Montreal, and spring is finally coming. A quick three mile run up the mountain. I was leaping off of stones, running through the woods, jumping over bollards and benches, playing tag with my girlfriend.   
  
Not all running has to be suffering. Sometimes it is a joy to move, to just enjoy the effort. See a rock? Jump on it. See a log? Jump over it. See a path? Follow it to wherever it goes.
