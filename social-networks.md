# Social Networks

These are the social networks you can find me on. While I may not respond quickly, I am trying to get better at checking them all once a week, to make sure that I get messages from people and that messages don't get dropped. I am including this list here as a means of making sure I check them once a week - I find that if I don't remember to do this, I end up not visiting one or the other for ages and forgetting about them, and messages get dropped. As always, the easiest way to reach me is via email: richard@burntfen.com.

Note: This does not include the many accounts I moderate, as those are liable to change.
