## Podcasts at Sustain

We have multiple podcasts we run at Sustain: the main Sustain podcast, the Sustain Open Source Design Podcast, the Ethics Podcast, and the CHAOSS Podcast. The Ethics Podcast is all taken care of by Chris Ward; the CHAOSS podcast is run by Georg Link and the CHAOSS team. The first two, however, are run entirely by us here.

#### Setting up a new podcast line

When setting a new podcast, consider these things: \

* Needs: producer for things that need to be done.
    * Some grunt work
    * Guests invited
    * Seen the docs before the podcast, prep bios
    * Uploads and published, 
    * Social media around it
* Set up Excel sheet for prospective guests
    * Location, gender, language to ensure diversity
    * Status, invited, time set up, pre-production docs, post-production, edited, published etc. 
* Panelists
    * Decision on how many panelists to have etc.
    * Need to consider balance of guest vs panelist voices.
    * Experimenting with curating panellists depending on the speaker.
* Things to set up
    * Name of podcast
    * Logo
    * Header images for each podcast. (e.g. Sustain podcast, changing colours for each visitor org). 
    * Jingle
    * Invite page with Calendly link and details
* Main challenges:
    * Sound editing
    * Show notes
    * Paul and Diane provide this service. 
        * C. $160 per podcast for audio and text. 
        * Includes audio improvement


#### Preproduction


* Invite guests to the podcast.
* Send them your Calendly link.
* Have a separate calendly, so that you don't book on your own time. Then, block out time in your calendly to make sure that you don't double book.
* Make a copy of the [guest template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yglmBK6hf4Nu2yhb8Anqveix6LimCC9blV9IYNO0OPo/edit?usp=sharing) and send it to them.


#### Recording the Podcast

I use this checklist for starting the Sustain podcast. The up-to-date version is available [here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/processes/introducing-the-sustain-podcast.md).


* Signals for moderators
  * Job of host to prompt next questions & putting the guest at ease.
  * Can use signals to show next question is there (e.g. mute/off-mute)
  * Editing can remove instances of people talking over each other.

#### Postproduction



* **Forward the recording verification email to Paul.**

Once Paul has sent along the recording and show notes, do the following:

* **Create a new Guest in Fireside**. Do this first, as it allows you to finish on the new episode format.
* **Create a new Episode in Fireside. **
    * **Add in the show notes. **[Here is a video describing how to do this.](https://share.getcloudapp.com/qGuErXeB) I use the [Docs to Markdown](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/docs_to_markdown/700168918607) Google Docs plugin to make this work faster.
    * **Design a new cover photo in Sketch**. I always use colors of the person's company, or something which seems relevant. When in doubt, green logos work from the original Sustain colors. [Here is a video on how to do this in Sketch](https://share.getcloudapp.com/4gu2Z2r1).
    * **Upload all of the details**. 
* **Schedule it for some Friday in the future.**
* **Block out time in your calendar to hype it when it is published.**

* **Send them the draft when it is out! Ask if they want changes.**

When it is published, do the following:

* **Hype**
    * **Tweet about it. **RT from your personal account.
    * **LinkedIn.**
    * **Sustain Discourse.**
    * **#opensource channel on OpenCollective.**
* **Send email to the guests.**
    * **Include a link to the social media posts.**


## Audio Content

I use an editor. This is from him. Typically, for a 45 minute show, he charges $160.

> If you want to try editing your podcast on your own. I always, ALWAYS suggest Descript. It’s a "text based" audio editor. You dump in your audio file, it generates a script, you edit the audio by deleting words on the script. We use this program is to remove filler words. Just don’t let it do every filler word it can. Just let it remove the umms and uhhs. If you let the AI remove them all it tends to make the conversation odd and choppy. 

> Just to give you an idea on how long editing takes, it’s usually 1-2 hours of editing for every 15 mins of run time. Everyone on Sustain is usually a good speaker, those take us right around 2 hours. That is not the norm. ;-) 

>If you need mics, and you SHOULD get them if you don’t. Some GREAT affordable mics are:

> When using a mic. 99% of podcasters are WAY too far from it. Especially using Zoom, they tend to focus on the video part and not pay attention to the audio quality. I would want you NO further then a “hang ten” sign (like you make with your hand) away from the mic. I’ve been doing this for 25+ years. When we mic people in our studios, they are usually only an inch or 2 from the mic. It’s the difference between sounding like you recorded in a studio (within a hang ten sign away)…to sounding like you recorded it in your bathroom (a foot away or more). We have stuff that can tighten it up. But there are always tradeoffs when we have to do it. So get close to the mic. :-) It’s weird at first, but you will get used to it.

> Length of podcast. Shorter is better. Shoot for 45 minutes or under. Why??! A typical podcast we edit loses 10% of it’s original listening audience for every 10 minutes of run time. So a 45 minute podcast will have lost 45% of it’s original audience by then end of the podcast. We do a lot of BIG network level podcasts. Almost all of them are around 30 minutes…and a few creep into 40 minutes. The idea also is to keep these “commuter length”. So someone driving into work can listen to the entire podcast on their way to work and finish it.
