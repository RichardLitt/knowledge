# William Gibson - Pattern Recognition

- Came off as dated.
- I didn't like the constant reference to jet lag and a soul catching up. It didn't add to the novel.
- Why all the motorcycle accidents?
- The 'mirror-world' metaphor was interesting, but strained. It was supposed to be through her eyes, but I never actually identified with the main character, which made all of this just seem like extra shit on top of the actual book.
- The tense changes and constant prodrop got very annoying, and lent to a run-on feel. The book was worse off for it.

## Notes

> "Jacques Costeau said that jet lag was his favorite drug."

> “We have no idea, now, of who or what the inhabitants of our future might be. In that sense, we have no future. Not in the sense that our grandparents had a future, or thought they did. Fully imagined cultural futures were the luxury of another day, one in which 'now' was of some greater duration. For us, of course, things can change so abruptly, so violently, so profoundly, that futures like our grandparents' have insufficient 'now' to stand on. We have no future because our present is too volatile. ... We have only risk management. The spinning of the given moment's scenarios. Pattern recognition”

Good.

> "black guest" perhaps (as Damien had once explained hackers and their more autonomous creations are known in China)

> ...a shade of blue she discovered in Northern Spain. An ancient tint, arsenic based.

I thought arsenic was red?

> What if the flow naturally tended to the path of least resistance? Where does that take you?

> ...though it proves to involve a kelp wrap, deep facial, manifold tweezings and plucings...

What is a kelp wrap?

> Walking up Roppongi Drive from the ANA Hotel, where she's had the cab drop her, into the shadow of the multitiered expressway that looks like the oldest thing in town. Tarkovsky, someone had once told her, had filmed parts of _Solaris_ here, using the expressway as found Future City.

This is a great segment of that movie.

> This makes her think of the first time she'd read Sherlock Holmes. A one-legged Lascar seaman.

> Cayce steps in and finds herself trying to rememebr Win's clever neurological explanation for déjà vu.

> The remains of the fabulous fanny job, she thinks, have come to resemble to the first attempts of a trainee mortician. She unwraps a bar of soap, reminds herself not to use the hotel's shampoo, which will have the wrong pH for gaijin hair...

1. Fabulous fanny job is really... not good.
2. Good metaphor, though.
3. Shampoo has an intended pH level?

pH Levels and Healthy Hair

Your hair consists of tiny shafts which are made up of scales, called cuticles. Water and alkaline-based hair products cause these scales to open, exposing the interior of your hair shafts. Ideally, you want to close this cuticle to protect it from harmful elements. To do this you’d want to choose a slightly acidic shampoo to close the cuticle and help the hair shaft retain moisture.

When you dye your hair, the coloring opens up the cuticle so the color absorbs completely into the cortex (interior of the hair shaft).To prevent the hair from drying out, your scalp naturally produces oil with slightly acidic pH to close the hair shafts. However, frequent coloring can result in your scalp producing too much oil, leaving your hair greasy. A pH-balanced shampoo not only helps keep cuticles closed but prevents the scalp from producing too much oil after treating your hair. After all, oily hair is the last thing you expect to have after treatment.

> "It's more the way it is now than it's ever been", Cayce replies, a line of Dwight David Eisenhower's that she sometimes resorts to when she has nothing whatever to offer.

Bill, please don't throw in so much useless information that no one would know. Who cares if Eisenhower's middle name is David? Also - where is this from. Ok: [according to this](http://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/01/29/like-ever/), it is misattributed.

> "Yes," says Ngemi, with quiet pride, "but now I am negotiating to buy Stephen King's Wang."
> Cayce stares at him.
> "The provenance", Ngemi assures her, "is immaculate, the price high, but, I believe, reasonable. A huge thing, one fo the early dedicated processors..."

Seriously, Bill?

> THE evening version of a Waterloo Sunday moves differently, and the pigeons Cayce had seen flying, that morning, now race fearlessly amid the feet of hurrying passengers, pecking up the day's bounty.

Do pigeons vary flight patterns by time of day?

> Really it is entirely about story, though not in any sense that any of you seem familiar with. Do you know nothing of narratology? Where is Derridean "play" and excessiveness? Foucauldian limit-attitude? Lyotardian language-games? Lacanian Imaginaries? Where is the commitment to praxis, positioning Jamesonian nostalgia, and despair—as well as Habermasian fears of irrationalism—as panic discourses signaling the defeat of Enlightenment hegemony over cultural theory? But no: discourses on this site are hopelessly retrograde. Mama Anarchia

I like this.

> Lots of Prada, Gucci, but in a Moneyed Bohemian modality too off-the-shelf for London or New York. LA, she realizes, except for two goth girls in black brocade, and a boy gotten up in impeccable High Grunge, it's Rodeo Drive with an extra helping of cheekbones.

Cheekbones are Gibson's Jordanian 'well turned calves'. Don't do that, Gibson. It's bad writing.

> And the fucking pilot's there. You can see the outline of his head, goggles it looked like. Never seen Brian pull his eye off the viewfinder when he's shooting but he did, just turned around with this WHAT THE FUCK???!!! look and I signal GO FOR IT, GET IT. So he did. All of it: them yanking the canopy open, and how they simply tore him apart, the pilot. Just came to pieces. They got a watch, a compass from the other wrist and a pistol, and they were fighting over them, falling off the wing, and he just came apart. And Brian got it all, plus Mick was second camera and he got a lot, plus the new guys. I mean coverage, lots. And at some point I look around at Marina and she's fucking laughing. Not your hysterics of horror, she's just fucking laughing at the humor of it. So I'm sitting here in the tent by myself, writing this, because with one thing and another I told her to just fuck off. And Mick and Brian are drunk, and I'm afraid to look at what they shot. I know I won't be, maybe even tomorrow, but now I think I will go and get well pissed. And how the fuck did he get under there with his airplane? So thank you, as they say, for listening, and don't forget to water the fucking goldfish. I hope you are okay with that shit you had happening. I love you.

This is the first piece of really great writing in the whole book.

> People had time, in those days. The system was collapsing under its own weight, but everyone had a job, often a pointless one, very badly paid, but one could eat. People valued friendships, talked endlessly, ate and drank. For many people it was like the life of a student. A life of the spirit. Now we say that everything Lenin taught us of communism was false, and everything he taught us of capitalism, true.

Also good.

>  And then she hears the sound of a helicopter, from somewhere behind her and, turning, sees the long white beam of light sweeping the dead ground as it comes, like a lighthouse gone mad from loneliness, and searching that barren ground as foolishly, as randomly, as any grieving heart ever has.

Also good.

> "Because he pretends to be better at what he does than he is. I prefer people who are better at what they do than they think they are."

Also good.

> He loves Paris, and says he hasn't been here since he was someone else, and very stupid.

Sums Paris up for me.
